# The World's Smartest DIY Disco Ball

This project combines technology and creativity to transform any gathering into a dynamic and interactive experience. Check out the full documentation and making-of on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRtyjE7GhiI).

## Overview

This DIY Disco Ball is not your average party accessory. It's equipped with sensors to interact with its environment, changing colors to match the surroundings and reacting to sounds, creating a unique light show in sync with the music or any noise in the room.

## Features

- **Color Detection:** The disco ball can detect specific colors in the room and change its lights to match them, creating a seamless integration with your party theme.
- **Sound Reactive:** Thanks to an integrated microphone, the disco ball responds to sound, turning any tune or voice into a captivating light display.
- **Customizable Patterns:** With programmable LEDs, you can create an endless variety of light patterns and sequences.
